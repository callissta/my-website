            <p>South Korea's history is fascinating, from ancient kingdoms to modern-day advancements...
                Such as <strong>Changdeokgung Palace</strong><br>
                Changdeokgung Palace, located in Waryong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, is one of the five Royal Palaces of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), and still contains the original palace structures and other remains intact. It was built in 1405 as a Royal Villa but became the Joseon dynasty’s official Royal Residence after Gyeongbokgung, the original principal palace, was destroyed by fire in 1592 when Japanese forces invaded Korea. Thereafter, it maintained its prestigious position until 1867, when Gyeongbokgung was renovated and restored to its original status. Changdeokgung was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.
